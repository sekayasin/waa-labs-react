# WAA-Labs - Reactify - Frontend

Each Lab is pushed in its own branch

## Lab8 - React (Axios)

Based on our backend [Lab4](https://github.com/sekayasin/waa-labs/tree/Lab4), make calls to the backend.

- Get all posts from the back-end and render them on the DashBoard Component under the Posts Component
- Make the PostDetails fetch a specific Post and display its details.
- Make the delete button functional on the PostDetails, it should delete the selected post and update the fetched posts.
- Make a AddPost component, that will take the post title, author, and content and add it to the database on your back-end
- Make the PostDetails component render the comments, which you would have to create a Comment Component.
