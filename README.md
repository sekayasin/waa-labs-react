Each Lab is pushed in its own branch

## Lab9 - React (Hooks)

This Lab is a continuation of Lab8 using useContext, useRef hooks

- Make the selected id for post a global value by using useContext()
- Make the NewPost form sent with useref()
- Make the Comment components render only when you render the PostDetails, it should not re-render unless the selected post (selected id) changes.
